## Disclaimer

Since version 6.0.0 the plugin is now a freemium plugin.

That means that the plugin is completely free to use, but some functionalities and extra features are only available for subscribed users.

There is also a free trial to test out those features before subscribing.

**Thanks for your support for all these years, I couldn't have done it without you!!!**

### Material Theme Bundles

Material Theme "**Bundles**" (or "plugins", or "addons") are a way to benefit of Material Theme's paid features separately,
without having to pay for the core plugin.

Since the plugin became paid, a lot of users were left disappointed by suddenly having to pay for features they have been enjoying for free,
leading to a lot of frustrations.
Although I've been trying to alleviate the frustration by giving more transparency about the reasons of the move,
or through free plans and vouchers, still, for some users, the loss of their favourite feature was unacceptable.

In fact, for some, they couldn't care less about the whole package, but THAT specific feature being unavailable was a true loss.

Introducing **Material Theme Bundles**: these are separate plugins that provide alternative access to the paid features.
For example, let's say you are only interested in the [Custom Theme](/docs/configuration/custom-themes.md) feature but don't need the [Tab Settings](/docs/configuration/tab-settings.md),
[Project Frame](/docs/configuration/project-frame-settings.md) or [Language Additions](configuration/color-scheme-additions.md), you would be able to purchase it separately and benefit from it without having to buy a premium license.

Of course, these bundles would not be free; otherwise there would be no point of having to purchase a premium license.
But they will be at a lesser price than the whole package.

At the moment,
the only bundle available is the [High Contrast](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17456-material-theme-ui-high-contrast) feature for an annual cost of $3 only.

Others will follow, depending on the demand. Currently, the planned ones for 2022 are:
- Custom Theme
- Language Additions
- Project Frame Colors
- Project View Settings

**PLEASE NOTE
THAT THESE BUNDLES MUST NOT BE BOUGHT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PREMIUM LICENSE.** They only provide access to the paid features to people on the free plan,
so buying them when you have a paid plan would only result in paying twice for the same thing.
