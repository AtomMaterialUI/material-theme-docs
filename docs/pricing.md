## Disclaimer

Starting from version 6.0.0, the plugin has become a **freemium** plugin. 

That means that the plugin is completely free to use, but some functionalities and extra features are only available for subscribed users.

A free trial is available, making possible to test out those features before subscribing.

**Thanks for your support for all these years!!!**

### Price lists

The plugin is delivered with a [perpetual license](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-a-perpetual-fallback-license-).
It means that after 12 months it becomes free to use for the current _Marketplace Version_, which isn't planned until at least mid-2023.

**Note:** _Marketplace Version_ doesn't mean **Plugin Version**!
That means that even if the plugin's version is changing (which it should), it doesn't mean that the marketplace version does.
Therefore, there is no need to renew the subscription past the first year.

### Material Theme bundles

Material Theme "**Bundles**" (or "plugins", or "addons") are a way to benefit of Material Theme's paid features separately,
without having to pay for the core plugin.

Since the plugin became paid, a lot of users were left disappointed by having to pay for features they have been enjoying for free,
leading to a lot of frustrations.

Although we've been trying to alleviate the frustration by giving more transparency about the reasons of the move,
or through free plans and vouchers, still, for some users, the loss of their favourite feature was unacceptable.

In fact, for some, they couldn't care less about the whole package, but having a specific feature being unavailable was a true loss.

Introducing **Material Theme Bundles**: these are separate plugins that provide alternative access to the paid features.
For example, say you are only interested in the [Custom Theme](/docs/configuration/custom-themes) feature 
but don't need the [Tab Settings](/docs/configuration/tab-settings.md),
[Project Frame](/docs/configuration/project-frame-settings.md) or [Language Additions](configuration/color-scheme-additions), 
you would be able to purchase it separately and benefit from it without having to buy the full package.

Of course, these bundles would not be free, otherwise there would be no incentive of having to purchase a premium license.
But they would be at a lesser price than the whole package.

At the moment,
the only available bundle is the [High Contrast](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17456-material-theme-ui-high-contrast) feature for an annual cost of $3 only.

Others should follow, depending on the demand. As of 2021, the planned ones for 2022 are:
- Custom Theme
- Language Additions
- Project Frame Colors
- Project View Settings
- etc.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BUNDLES MUST NOT BE BOUGHT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PREMIUM LICENSE.**
They only provide access to the paid features to people on the free plan,
so buying them when you have a paid plan would only result in paying twice for the same thing.
