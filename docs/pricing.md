## Disclaimer

Since version 6.0.0 the plugin is now a freemium plugin.

That means that the plugin is completely free to use, but some functionalities and extra features are only available for subscribed users.

There is also a free trial to test out those features before subscribing.

**Thanks for your support for all these years, I couldn't have done it without you!!!**
