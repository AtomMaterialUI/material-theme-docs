## Quick Actions Panel

The Quick Actions Panel is a set of actions and toggles to quickly customize the plugin. You can find this panel in many
places:
- Inside the menu, under `Tools → Material Theme`

{% include figure.html content="/screens/toolsMenu.png" caption="Tools Menu" %}

- At the end of the main toolbar

{% include figure.html content="/screens/toolbar.png" caption="Main Toolbar" %}

- As an option of the `Quick Switch Panel`

{% include figure.html content="/screens/quickswitch.png" caption="Quick Switch" %}

You can also set a shortcut to open every one of its submenus from the
`Settings → Appearance and Behavior → Keymap → Material Theme` settings.

## Material Theme Switcher

The first subpanel is a switcher to rapidly switch between the themes. There you can find all the available themes plus the two custom themes.

{% include figure.html content="/screens/switcher.png" caption="Theme Switcher" %}

**Note**: Custom Themes and some themes are only available for premium users.
