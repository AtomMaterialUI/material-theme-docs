This page is not really a configuration but another way to discover and install plugins.

## Recommended plugins page

The Material Theme UI is a great plugin, but there are also literally thousands of other plugins available in the Marketplace. Some are great, some not so much, but in any case it can be
a little hard to get to find out the hidden pearls in this sea of available options.

Introducing the **Recommended plugins**: It's another settings page found inside the _Material Theme Settings_ that showcases a hand-picked list of useful plugins and remarkable themes for you to discover at a glance rather than navigating the whole sea of available plugins in the Marketplace.

{% include figure.html content="/screens/recommendedPlugins.png" caption="Recommended Plugins" %}

Most of these plugins are UI-related, grouped into three sections:
- **Recommended plugins**: Hand-picked list of great plugins to use alongside the Material Theme UI.
- **Material Plugins**: These are the standalone paid plugins that you can buy separately instead of the main plugin.
- **Great Themes**: Curated list of amazing themes that can be sideloaded with the Material Theme UI.

Come take a look! And if you have other great recommendations, please post them on the chat or in the GitHub repo!

Oh and by the way: this is a purely subjective list! So please don't be mad if a plugin you love isn't on the list!
