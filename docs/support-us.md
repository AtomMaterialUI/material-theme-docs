Up until 2021, Material Theme UI was an open-source plugin. It is made with love by people that love good design and want the world to be a better place.

Although it has become a paid/freemium plugin, if you like this plugin or the other plugins made by the developers, and appreciate the work done for it to exist, you can still support the developers by donating.
