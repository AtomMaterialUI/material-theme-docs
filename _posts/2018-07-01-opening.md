Hi everyone, this is **Mallowigi** :wave:

This marks the debut of the **Material Theme for JetBrains blog**. In this blog I'll be talking about new features, development ideas, tips and tricks or simply stuff that I care about ;D.

Note that this is my first time building and writing in a blog, so I'm really excited but also kind of embarassed :*. Also English is not my mother tongue (oui monsieur!) so I might make spelling mistakes. If you ever find some, please report them ;)

I will be posting in my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mallowigi){:target="_blank"} updates about the plugin and the blog/site, as well as on the [Slack channel](https://material-theme-ui.slack.com){:target="_blank"}. So don't forget to follow it up!

I'm also taking this opportunity to thank all the people that have been supporting me during all this time, as well as the people that made this plugin possible. Thanks guys you're the best!
